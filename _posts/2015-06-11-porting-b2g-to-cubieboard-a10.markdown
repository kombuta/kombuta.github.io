A while back, I received a [cubie development kit](http://cubie.co.za/product/cubie-development-kit) from [cubie.co.za](http://cubie.co.za). My mission is to port B2G, an open source mobile platform developed by Mozilla, to the cubieboard A10 that came as part of the development kit. This exercise will allow me to learn more about the internals of B2G and embedded systems. 

So I will be posting updates on my progress here.
