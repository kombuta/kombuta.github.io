A couple of months ago I participated in my first Kickstarter campaign where I was backing the [Pebble Time](https://getpebble.com/pebble_time) smartwatch. I wanted to explore this new realm of smartwatch gadgets and so I submitted my pledge. About two weeks ago I received my Pebble Time watch and I have been using it everyday ever since. Below are my sentiments about it.

The Pebble time watch is a practical device. Because it uses a color e-paper display, the battery lasts for about a week. One can change the watch faces to suit his or her mood  and you can install apps on it via a mobile app which is available on Android and iOS.My favourite app at the moment is Misfit, which tracks my activity and sleeping patterns. This Pebble app can work on it's own  without relying on  smartphone app. However if you want to keep a long history of your metrics then you have to download the smartphone app and sync your data to it. 

You can also set the watch show notifications from your phone, e.g. when a text message or a phone call is coming in. You can then view the text message, but cannot send any response back, unless if you are using Android, in which case you can send voice memos. I found this to be very handy during long meetings, where I can cancel calls and view messages on my wrist without causing any disturbances. However, if you are subscribed to group chats on Whatsapp, the notifications can become annoying, hence I have switched off all notifications from group chats.

Another feature that I like is the ability to control music from the smartwatch which is handy when you are riding a bike or hiking. 

As a developer I'm excited to start writing apps for the watch and hopefully spin off a couple of innovative ideas from there :). What captured my interest the most is the concept of [smartstraps](http://developer.getpebble.com/smartstraps/), were the watch straps can be embedded with sensors of all sorts and connected to the watch via serial connection that exits on the smartstrap connector, which is also used for charging the watch. This opens up avenues for innovation that encompass hardware and software and I'm really excited about that. 

All in all I'm happy with the Pebble Time Smartwatch. The only draw back is the inability to reply to messages even with a predefined "OK", "NO" or "YES". Maybe that will become a feature in future releases of the Pebble watch OS. And lastly it would be great if it worked with Firefox OS :)
